# ShoppingManager

The intent behind this project is an attempt to automate dominantly cyclic shopping as much as possible. Most commercial shopping centers now allow shopping online and at-store pickup. Walmart even has an API!

## High level use-case

Most people buy items in a cyclic manner. E.g: Paper towels once every two weeks, eggs every week, etc. The same items are typically bought (future expansion could include things like looking for cheaper alternatives, etc) within some period.

Users should be able to save items they buy frequently with (optional) information on frequency. Once it is time to shop again, users could rapidly select from their saved items to generate their new shopping list.
